    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Jollof rice is a rich and incredbly tasty one-pot meal popular in the West African regions of Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria, Togo, Liberia, and Sierra Leon. It has its origins from the wollof people of Senegal, West Africa.
    </p>
    <p>Though each country and also, households within these countries have their own way of making this sumptuous dish, the common practice is to cook rice in a flavorful and tasty tomato stew. Some countries, especially Ghana and Nigeria have created what is popularly known as the "jollof wars" out of this delicacy; an unending "war" about which country cooks it best. But most Africans will agree with me that there is no absolute right or wrong way of making the jollof dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Uncooked rice.</li>
        <li>fresh tomatoes and/or tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Onions.</li>
        <li>Garlic.</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Cooking oil.</li>
        <li>Meat broth/water.</li>
        <li>Spices of your choice. e.g. bayleaf, thyme, curry powder, black pepper, etc.</li>
        <li>Salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Stock cube to taste.</li>
        <li>Vegetables like carrot, peas, green pepper, etc.(optional).</li>
        <li>Scotch bonnets (if you like your food hot).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend your onions, ginger, scotch bonnets and garlic. Put it aside.</li>
        <li>Heat your cooking oil in a cooking pot. Put your stove on low heat.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger, garlic, scotch bonnet and onion mixture to the heatedf oil. Stir for about a minute or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Blend or dice your fresh tomatoes and add it to the pot. you can choose to add a little of some store bought tomato paste to give it a rch color. Some may choose to use only fresh tomatoes or only tomato paste. it all boils down to personal preference.</li>
        <li>Stir under medium heat for about 5min.</li>
        <li>Add your choice of spices, i.e thyme, bayleaf, currypowder, etc. You can also add your stock cube and salt at this stage.</li>
        <li>Stir for another 5min under medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add your broth/water accordingly (the amount of rice determines how much water to add.</li>
        <li>Rinse the rice if you don't want it starchy. Do not parboil if you don't want your jollof to turn out soggy.</li>
        <li>Add your rice to the cooking pot and stir well.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and let the it cook for 10-15min.</li>
        <li>After 15min you can check your rice to see whether it is well cooked or it still needs some water.</li>
        <li>If the rice is still a bit hard, you can add a little water to the bottom to avoid the ingredients seeping to the bottom of the pot and reducing its yumminess.</li>
        <li>Chech again after 5-7min. If the water is absorbed and you feel the texture is right for you, then your jollof rice is ready.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
